About the Project:

This was a personal idea I had: 

I wanted to create a machine learning model that could quickly and accurately identify a face so that I could use it in an application with an identification aspect.

My process is as follows:

First, I am building a model that can correctly identify a face without having seen the picture before. Next, I plan to build code that attaches to an application on a smartphone or another smart device.
