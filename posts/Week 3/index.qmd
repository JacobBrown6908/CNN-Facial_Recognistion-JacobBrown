This is my 3rd week of building my model for a facial recognition software. This week, I spent most of the time working on my resume with a Quarto building tool we have been developing. I have been trying to learn how Docker works, but this is something I don't fully understand, and research has not helped me to reopen my container. However, I hope that I can continue to build up my resume and work on getting it on one page.

I also worked on transitioning my code to Google Colab so I can save my weights and work on building my model from where I left off. This came with a handful of problems that I was not expecting to encounter. First, I needed to learn more about a new library that helps to connect to my Google Drive. Second, I needed to add a new folder and understand how paths work in Google Drive compared to my local memory. Lastly, I needed to learn how to call weights and where to put code to save weights.

This week felt like when I solved one of these issues, I ran into another issue, but I eventually got the code to work, and now I am able to save and call my weights on my Drive.

Here are a few snippets of code that I was working on this week regarding my code:

```
checkpoint_path = "/content/drive/My Drive/Senior_Project/check_points/checkpoint_13.weights.h5"

if os.path.exists(checkpoint_path):
    print("Loading saved weights...")
    model.load_weights(checkpoint_path)
else:
    print("No saved weights found, training from scratch.")
```

```
checkpoint_dir = "/content/drive/MyDrive/Senior_Project/check_points"
checkpoint_path = os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, "checkpoint_{epoch:02d}.weights.h5")  # Save weights

# Ensure the checkpoint directory exists
if not os.path.exists(checkpoint_dir):
    os.makedirs(checkpoint_dir)

# Define model checkpoint callback
model_checkpoint_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
    filepath=os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, "checkpoint_{epoch:02d}.weights.h5"),
    save_weights_only=True,
    monitor='val_accuracy',
    mode='max',
    save_best_only=True
)
```
