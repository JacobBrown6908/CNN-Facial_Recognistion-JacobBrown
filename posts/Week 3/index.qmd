This is my 3ed week of building my model for a facial recognistion softwear. This week I spent most of the time working on my resume witha Quarto building tool we have been devilping. I have been trying to learn how Docker works but this is somthing I don't fully understnad and research has not helped me to reopen my container. but I hope that I can continue to build up my resume anad work on getting on one page. I also worked on transistioning my code to google colabs so I can save my weights and work on building my model from where I left off. This came with a handful of problems that I was not expecting to encoundter. First, I needed to learn more about a new library that helps to conect to my googole Drive, second I needed to add a new folder and understand how paths work in the google Drive compared to my local memory. and Lastly I needed to learn how to call weights and where to put code to save weights. This week felt like when I solved one of these isues I ran into another isue. but I eventuly got the code to work and now I am able to save and call my weights on my Drive. here are a few snips of code that I was working on this week regarding my code:


```
checkpoint_path = "/content/drive/My Drive/Senior_Project/check_points/checkpoint_13.weights.h5"

if os.path.exists(checkpoint_path):
    print("Loading saved weights...")
    model.load_weights(checkpoint_path)
else:
    print("No saved weights found, training from scratch.")
```

```
checkpoint_dir = "/content/drive/MyDrive/Senior_Project/check_points"
checkpoint_path = os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, "checkpoint_{epoch:02d}.weights.h5")  # Save weights

# Ensure the checkpoint directory exists
if not os.path.exists(checkpoint_dir):
    os.makedirs(checkpoint_dir)

# Define model checkpoint callback
model_checkpoint_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
    filepath=os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, "checkpoint_{epoch:02d}.weights.h5"),
    save_weights_only=True,
    monitor='val_accuracy',
    mode='max',
    save_best_only=True
)
```
