### Weekly Work Update

This week, I was working on job applications and informational interviews. I had an informational interview with a family friend who works for Lockheed Martin at Hill Air Force Base. This is a location where I would like to work, so I was able to connect with her and talk about what she does in software engineering. I also asked her for contacts with others in her field.

Then, I started working on a website for my poster board. I want to build a Streamlit website to put a QR code on my board and improve the quality of the poster board.
